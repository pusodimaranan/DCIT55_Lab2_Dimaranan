 MySQL Functions, Group By, Order By and Constraints
 This laboratory is a hands-on database activity where I designed and modified a student information table, applied SQL functions for data formatting and computation, and implemented constraints to maintain data integrity. This activity helped me strengthened my practical skills in database structuring, data manipulation, and query optimization.
